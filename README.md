The Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act, often shortened to ACA and nicknamed Obamacare, is a United States federal statute enacted by the 111th United States Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23rd 2010. The repeal of the Medicaid expansion and collapse of the individual insurance market, as a result of the repeal of the ACA, could threaten strides the country has made in advancing the health care of the nation, rural America particularly.

The ACA does lots of important things including offering Americans a number of new benefits, rights and protections in regard to healthcare, setting up a Health Insurance Marketplace(healthcare.gov) where Americans can purchase federally regulated and subsidized health insurance, expanding Medicaid to all adults and improving medicare for seniors and those with long-term disabilities to name a few.

The new administration led by a Republican president ran on the promise of “Repeal and Replacing” Obamacare and has released its blueprint for Healthcare named the “American Healthcare Act” (AHCA). The Congressional Budget Office CBO, an independent federal agency which provides budget and economic information to Congress has estimated that as many as 24 million Americans could lose insurance if the AHCA passes.
